                <p>Linkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand
                    Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. Their fifth album, Living Things
                    (2012),
                    combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party

                    electronic and pop-oriented record</p>
